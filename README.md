# Readme and weep
This is a CodeBlocks config file containing my settings for C/C++ syntax highlighting (colours etc).  
Installing this will probably overwrite your settings...  
This only exists to make my life easier when I have a fresh start on a RasPi. It's not exactly how I like my syntax highlighting, just better than the default.

## Installation
### Unix-type systems
1. Put `default.conf` in `~/.config/codeblocks/`
2. Open CodeBlocks
3. Navigate to `Settings > Editor > Syntax Highlighting`
4. Use the `Colour theme:` drop-down box to select `iainstheme`

### Windows systems
- Dunno, never tried it; I use Visual Studio on Windows. Probably goes somewhere in `/appdata/`. Google it.
